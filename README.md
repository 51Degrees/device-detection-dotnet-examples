## Examples

The examples provided demonstrate how to use the 51Degrees device detection in
both cloud-based and on-premise environments. They showcase different aspects of
device detection, including retrieving device details based on User-Agent and
User-Agent Client Hints HTTP header values, accessing meta-data, performing TAC
and native model lookups, viewing match metrics, offline processing, and
performance optimization. These examples serve as practical guides for
developers to understand and implement device detection capabilities within
their applications.

## Cloud resource keys

A resource key configured with the properties needed to run most of the examples
can be obtained [here](https://configure.51degrees.com/jqz435Nc). To use the
resource key in the example it can be supplied as an environment variable called
"SUPER_RESOURCE_KEY".

Some cloud examples require an enhanced resource key containing a license key.
And some on-premise examples require you to provide a license key. You can find
out about resource keys and license keys at our [pricing
page](https://51degrees.com/pricing).

## Running examples with changes to Pipeline packages

A common use case is to make a change to the Pipeline logic in
device-detection-dotnet and then use these examples to observe the results of
the change.

By default, the examples are configured to use the packages from nuget feed. In
order to produce and use local packages instead:

-   Clone and make your changes to device-detection-dotnet
-   Create and install the packages to the local nuget feed `dotnet pack
    [Project] -o "[PackagesFolder]" /p:PackageVersion=0.0.0 -c [Configuration]
    /p:Platform=[Architecture]` `dotnet nuget push "[PackagesFolder]/*.nupkg" -s
    LocalFeed `
-   Update the version of the device-detection-dotnet in the examples project: `
    dotnet add package "FiftyOne.DeviceDetection" --version 0.0.0 --source
    LocalFeed`

The same principle can be applied to incorporate changes in pipeline-dotnet if
needed.

The tables below describe the examples available in this repository.
